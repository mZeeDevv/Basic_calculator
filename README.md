## Use of eval()
Basic calculator with functions I have checked a lot of people uses if() else() conditions for operators (*+/-) when creating a simple calculator, but in this code, I have used eval().

## What is eval() for?
which is a JS built-in function that evaluates a string as JavaScript code and executes it.It takes a string as an argument and dynamically interprets that string.

## Output
![Calculator](https://github.com/mZeeDevv/Basic_calculator/assets/62940100/9d026655-ad01-42fa-9cef-151ee1aa23d6)
